# Aseprite-Glazed-Terracotta-Helper
An Aseprite script for helping to make glazed terracotta textures for minecraft.

Uses 45 degree mirroring and also rotates the resulting sprite into the 4 quadrants of the sprite.


## Installation and Usage:
1. Put 'glazed-terracotta-editor.lua' into Aseprite scripts folder (File->Scripts->Open Script Folder)

4. Make sure sprite takes up full canvas by placing pixels in the top left and bottom right

2. Run script with File->Scripts->glazed-terracotta-editor

5. Updates only occur on bottom right corner of canvas.

## Also
If you can make this run faster or cleaner, or want to edit bits and pieces to remove/add features, be my guest.
